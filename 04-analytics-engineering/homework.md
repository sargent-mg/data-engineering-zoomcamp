# Module 4 Homework: Analytics Engineering with dbt.

### Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

- `stg_green_tripdata`, `stg_yellow_tripdata`, and `int_trips_unioned` (upstream dependencies)
- Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to `int_trips_unioned`
- **`int_trips_unioned` only**
- `int_trips_unioned`, `int_trips`, and `fct_trips` (downstream dependencies)

---

### Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?

- dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
- **dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code**
- dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
- dbt will update the configuration to include the new value

### Question 3. Counting Records in `fct_monthly_zone_revenue`

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?

- 12,998
- 14,120
- **12,184**
- 15,421

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `dtc-de-course-454704.nytaxi_prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue` LIMIT 1;
```

---

### Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the **highest total revenue** (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for **Green** taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

- **East Harlem North**
- Morningside Heights
- East Harlem South
- Washington Heights South

```sql
SELECT 
    pickup_zone, 
    SUM(revenue_monthly_total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM `dtc-de-course-454704.nytaxi_prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE 
    service_type = 'Green' 
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST(revenue_month AS DATE)) = 2020
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, what is the **total number of trips** (`total_monthly_trips`) for Green taxis in October 2019?

- 500,234
- 350,891
- **384,624**
- 421,509

```sql
SELECT 
    sum(total_monthly_trips) as total_trips
FROM `dtc-de-course-454704.nytaxi_prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE 
    service_type = 'Green'
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST(revenue_month AS DATE)) = 2019
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CAST(revenue_month AS DATE)) = 10
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the **For-Hire Vehicle (FHV)** trip data for 2019.

1. Load the [FHV trip data for 2019](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv) into your data warehouse
2. Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
   - Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num IS NULL`
   - Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `dtc-de-course-454704.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata_ext`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://dtc-de-course-454704-nytaxi/fhv/*.csv.gz'],
  compression = 'GZIP',
  skip_leading_rows = 1
);

SELECT count(*)
FROM `dtc-de-course-454704.nytaxi.stg_fhv_tripdata`
LIMIT 1;
```

What is the count of records in `stg_fhv_tripdata`?

- 42,084,899
- **43,244,693**
- 22,998,722
- 44,112,187
